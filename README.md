## Day 13 & 14 Homework
### Landmark

DC gets a crazy amount of tourists coming to see the various landmarks. We want to help them find some of the best stuff.

MINIMUM requirements for this assignment:
* Create an app called Landmark that uses Core Data to hold information on at least 10 landmarks around DC
* The landmarks should be displayed on both a map and a table view (which use the same array)
* In map view, the landmark needs to display the location via a pin, plus the name and street addres
* In table view, the landmark needs to display the name, address, and image of the landmark
* The user can alternate between map view & table view using tabs on the bottom
* Provide a detail view that displays more information such as a description, web link (that opens in a browser), and phone number (that can be dialed)
* The detail view also includes modern sharing buttons

OPTIONAL hard mode for this assignment:
* Allow users to rearrange the landmarks in table view and then create directions to each using that order on the map view
